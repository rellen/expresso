# A copy of the talk about Line 4. The source is `talks/line-4/deck.exs` in

#
# The copy is the same as the source, with one difference: `@page` is the
# path of `line-4.html`, a copy of `line-4/index.html` of iso-factories at
# commit 1f436ef. The code slides find their lines in that file by their
# text.

# The slides fit a window of 1920 × 1080. Open the document with `?check` at
# the end of the address to make sure.
